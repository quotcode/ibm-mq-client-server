Data coming from : MQ, API, Flat file-based Extract   [XML[10],CSV(comma separated, pipe separated, semicolon etc), Fixed length flat file[10]]

Layer1:	 [  ---- TCS BANC's  ---- ]

Note: MFT to SFTP files from BANc's to SMTB DB

Layer2: [ ---- Middlelayer ----]

Layer3: [ ----- Downstream Applications  ----]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Processes:
1. Processes of Banc's 
	Sub-processes
	-- Reading MQ messages and store in DB
	-- calling API and storing data in DB
	-- Reading File Based Extract and store in DB
2. Process of Middle layer
	-- transform data specific to each of downstream applications
3. Reconcilation: reconcilation of data intra day and EOD
3. UI/App Server: to monitor the complete data loads and search pages etc

Framework
Queue name, Queue type(Consume, redirect)

1. Multiple queues can be created and confiugred dyanamically in db without changing anything on codebase for future new parties and queues
2. Create multiple template based on fle type and its attributes in DB
3. Now, separate classes for various file types (XML,CSV,Fixed Width etc) and read and write logic for them in separate class dedicated files.
4. Resusability, flexibility, dynamic config, best practices
5. to implment: use spring batch, springboot ? etc
